This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

You can see the demo [HERE](https://pisc9211.github.io/counter/). 
This was deployed using gh-pages.

### About
This is a very basic counter application. You can increment && decrement the count and it will dynamically render it to the page. There is a reset button which re-initializes the count to 0 and a Single/Double button which determines if the increment button will increase the count by 1 or 2. Same with the decrement.

To run this project on local machine please fork/download the repo. Go into the root folder of the repo and run the commands
